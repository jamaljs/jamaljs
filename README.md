JaMaL stands for JML which is javascript markup language. "a"'s are just filling.

> Jamal (Arabic: ÿ¨ŸÖÿßŸÑ‚Äé JamƒÅl/«¶amƒÅl ) is an Arabic masculine given name, meaning "beauty". The use of this name is widespread across the Muslim world. In Egypt the name is pronounced […°√¶Ààm√¶Àêl] and so is normally spelled Gamal . Tunisians may spell it Jamel. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal)

### Philosophy

JaMaL is for creating html content with javascript functions. A "J" function takes three arguments which are attributes, children and debug config. Just this. No need to know fancy observers, reducers or something like that. 

#### Why "JaMaL"?

Obviously i'm not arab or arab fan or things like that. I made a library called `jml.js` which stands for `javascript markup language`. I wanted to remake of that library and didn't wanted to find a new name. But `jml` and `jml.js` already picked on npm so i needed to little changes and thats where `JaMaL` came from. I just filled gaps with `a`'s. After that i needed a new logo with that middle eastern name so i used [Launchaco Logo Maker](http://launchaco.com/logo) to make a logo that makes sense with new name.

#### What is it for?

Simply; creating dom nodes with programmatic way. 
Complex way: There soo many javascript frameworks hanging around and i wanted to make a protest to this community. You don't need a framework for every thing, just use jQuery or write yourself.

### Whom is it for?

Of course this is not for huge projects. It was just a hobby to me so i hope same for you to.

### Basic Usage

I'm not going to explain figure it out yourself:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script src="./jml.min.js"></script>
<script>
    Jml.initialize({
        customTags: ['theme', 'example', 'akinozgen', 'profile-image', 'user-avatar']
    });

    const jmlInstance = new Jml.create('#root', jDiv({ class: 'container blog-post' }, [
        jArticle({ class: 'article-body' }, [
            jImg({ src: 'http://placehold.it/200x200' }, []),
            jP({ style: 'margin-bottom: 10px' }, ['lorem....']),
            jA({ href: '#', target: '_blank' }, ['Click Me!'])
        ])
    ]));

    jmlInstance.render();
</script>
```

#### JMLInstance

JMLInstance returns an object that has five elements. They are:
* `body`: dom element that selected by given selector.
* `render`: render method renders markup to `body`
* `clear`: truncates `body`
* `getRef`: returns dom element by provided `_id`. `_id` is randomly created by jml.
* `markup`: created dom content. 


#### jSomething functions

jSomething functions are totally html tags can be used as functions.
For example html has `acticle` tag, jml has `jArticle` tag. Also jSomething tags can be created by given custom tags in `jmlInstance.initialize` method.

jSomething methods also has config options. Currently it has just two options, `debug` and `inspect`.
Debug option gives information about jSomething function runtime, inspect options puts debugger in that jSomething method.

> Some references to clear it out:

```javascript
"header"          = jHeader(attibutes: Object<string, any>, children:any|jSomething);
"some-custom-tag" = jSomeCustomTag(attibutes: Object<string, any>, children:any|jSomething);
"script"          = jScript(attibutes: Object<string, any>, children:any|jSomething);
"audio"           = jAudio(attibutes: Object<string, any>, children:any|jSomething); 
"blockquote"      = jBlockquote(attibutes: Object<string, any>, children:any|jSomething); 
```

#### Accessing refs

Your `jmlInstance` object has property called `getRef`. Which is a function, takes string for `_id` attribute.
This method returns a reference from actual dom tree so you can easily inspect your actual dom.

Usage:
```javascript
    jmlInstance.getRef('_c0dq6bv4v');
    // output
    // <th _id="_c0dq6bv4v">Username</th>
```

#### Nesting

Everything is jSomething method, a jSomething method takes an argument which can be another jSomething method. So you need to understand nesting carefuly.

There is some complex example:

![Nesting Example](src/img/nesting.png)

And thats actual render:

![Rendered table](src/img/output.png)

Theres just few important points to care about
* Always give at least two arguments to a jSomething function
* First arg. must be Object. It can be empty but cant be without it.
* Second arg. is content object which must be an array. Can be empty but cant be without it.
* Second arg. can contain another jSomething function, string, array or number 

#### Callbacks

A jSomething functions second args (which is an array) can be mapped with `.map`, `.filter` or functions like that. One obligation: it must be an array after all.


### Get Started

Clone project to you local machine. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` command. 

#### Development

Run `yarn watch` command and open http://localhost:8080 from your browser and get started. No not modify `src/index.js` unless you know what you're doing. `src/index.js` file is main jml library file. If you want to use jml (not developing it) import another script or write it inside html file.
